### 💦 The App

This is just another app to motivate you to track how much water you drink throuhgout the day.
There's an article [HERE](https://medium.com/@caiobzen/fast-app-prototyping-with-swiftui-39ae03ab3eaa) explaining how I build this app.

### 🌊 Motivation

I decided to make this app just to play around with SwiftUI and learning more about how does it work on the WatchOS environment. I was curious specially about how could I create some sort of "wavy" animation.

### 💻 Requirements
- iOS 13+
- XCode 11

### 🤓 How to run
Since this project has zero dependencies on external frameworks, all you need is:
- `⌘ + R` *(and that's it)*

### ☑️ Todo
1. Persist the Water target during sessions
2. Create a daily log
